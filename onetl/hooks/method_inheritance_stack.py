class MethodInheritanceStack:
    """
    Context manager which can track the method calls within class inheritance diagram.

    For inherited class, overridden method contains a ``super().method(...)`` call.
    If base class method is registered as a slot, and there are some hooks bound to it,
    calling the inherited class method can cause calling the same hook twice -
    both on inherited class and base (due to calling ``super()``).

    This context manager allows to track such ``super()`` calls, allowing to
    prevent the same hook from being executed twice.

    Examples
    --------

    .. code:: python

        @support_hooks
        class BaseClass:
            @slot
            def some_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
                pass


        @support_hooks
        class MyClass(BaseClass):
            @slot
            def some_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
                self.do_something()
                super().some_method(*args, **kwargs)

            with MethodInheritanceStack(BaseClass, "some_method") as method_call_stack:
