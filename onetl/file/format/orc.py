    ORC file format. |support_hooks|

    Based on `Spark ORC Files <https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-orc.html>`_ file format.

    Supports reading/writing files with ``.orc`` extension.

    .. note ::

        You can pass any option to the constructor, even if it is not mentioned in this documentation.
        **Option names should be in** ``camelCase``!

        The set of supported options depends on Spark version. See link above.

    Examples
    --------

    Describe options how to read from/write to ORC file with specific options:

    .. code:: python

        orc = ORC(compression="snappy")
