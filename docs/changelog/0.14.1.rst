0.14.1 (2025-11-25)
===================

Dependencies
------------

Release `minio==7.2.19 <https://github.com/minio/minio-py/issues/1536>`_  lead to broken ``S3`` connector with errors like these:

.. code::

    TypeError: Minio.fget_object() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given
    TypeError: Minio.fput_object() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given

Fixed.

Added limit ``minio<8.0`` to avoid `breaking things <https://github.com/minio/minio-py/pull/1530>`_ in next major release.
