==================

Features

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed validation of ``headers`` column is written to Kafka with default ``Kafka.WriteOptions()`` - default value was ``False``,
  but instead of raising an exception, column value was just ignored. (:github:pull:`131`)
- Fix reading data from Oracle with ``partitioningMode="range"`` without explicitly set ``lowerBound`` / ``upperBound``. (:github:pull:`133`)
- Update Kafka documentation with SSLProtocol usage. (:github:pull:`136`)
- Raise exception if someone tries to read data from Kafka topic which does not exist. (:github:pull:`138`)
- Allow to pass Kafka topics with name like ``some.topic.name`` to DBReader. Same for MongoDB collections. (:github:pull:`139`)
