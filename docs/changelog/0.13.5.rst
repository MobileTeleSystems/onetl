0.13.4 (2025-04-14)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

0.13.0 changed the way ``Greenplum.check()`` is implemented - it begin checking DB availability from both Spark driver and executor.
But due to misspell, ``SELECT`` queries were emitted from all available executors. This lead to opening too much connections to Greenplum,
which was unexpected.

Now only one Spark executor is used to run ``Greenplum.check()``.
