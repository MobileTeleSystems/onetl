Kafka connector documentation said that it does support reading topic data incrementally by passing ``group.id`` or ``groupIdPrefix``.
Actually, this is not true, because Spark does not send information to Kafka which messages were consumed.
So currently users can only read the whole topic, no incremental reads are supported.
