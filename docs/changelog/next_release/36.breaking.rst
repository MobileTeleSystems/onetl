Rename methods of ``FileConnection`` classes:

* ``get_directory`` → ``resolve_dir``
* ``get_file`` → ``resolve_file``
* ``listdir`` → ``list_dir``
* ``mkdir`` → ``create_dir``
* ``rmdir`` → ``remove_dir``

They were undocumented in previous versions, but someone could use these methods, so this is a breaking change.
