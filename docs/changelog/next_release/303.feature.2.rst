Collect Spark execution metrics in following methods, and log then in DEBUG mode:
* ``DBWriter.run()``
* ``FileDFWriter.run()``
* ``Hive.sql()``
* ``Hive.execute()``

This is implemented using custom ``SparkListener`` which wraps the entire method call, and
then report collected metrics. But these metrics sometimes may be missing due to Spark architecture,
so they are not reliable source of information. That's why logs are printed only in DEBUG mode, and
are not returned as method call result.
