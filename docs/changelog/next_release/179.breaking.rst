| Change the way of passing ``hwm`` to ``DBReader`` and ``FileDownloader`` classes:
| **DBReader** before:

.. code-block:: python

    reader = DBReader(
        connection=...,
        source=...,
        hwm_column=("col1", "cast(col1 as date)"),
    )

after:

.. code-block:: python

    reader = DBReader(
        connection=...,
        source=...,
        hwm=DBReader.AutoHWM(
            entity="col1",
            expression="cast(col1 as date)",
            name="...",
        ),
    )

| **FileDownloader** before:

.. code-block:: python

    downloader = FileDownloader(
        connection=...,
        source_path=...,
        target_path=...,
        hwm_type="file_list",
    )

after:

.. code-block:: python

    downloader = FileDownloader(
        connection=...,
        source_path=...,
        target_path=...,
        hwm=FileListHWM(name="..."),
    )

| Now user can pass custom hwm classes into ``hwm`` field in ``DBReader`` or ``FileDownloader``
| Classes from etl_entities.old_hwm are marked as **deprecated**
| Raise deprecation warning if user passes "hwm_column" (in ``DBReader``), "hwm_type" (in ``FileDownloader``):
> "... class is deprecated since version 0.10.0. It will be removed in future versions..."
