Serialize DateTimeHWM to Clickhouse's ``DateTime64(6)`` (precision up to microseconds) instead of ``DateTime`` (precision up to seconds).

For Clickhouse below 21.1 comparing column of type ``DateTime`` with a value of type ``DateTime64`` was not supported, returning an empty dataframe.
To avoid this, replace:

.. code:: python

    DBReader(
        ...,
        hwm=DBReader.AutoDetectHWM(
            name="my_hwm",
            expression="hwm_column",  # <--
        ),
    )

with:

.. code:: python

    DBReader(
        ...,
        hwm=DBReader.AutoDetectHWM(
            name="my_hwm",
            expression="CAST(hwm_column AS DateTime64)",  # <--
        ),
    )
