Previously ``MSSQL.fetch(...)`` and ``MySQL.fetch(...)`` opened a read-write connection, despite documentation said that is should be read-only.
Now this is fixed:
* ``MSSQL.fetch(...)`` establishes connection with ``ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly``.
* ``MySQL.fetch(...)`` calls ``SET SESSION TRANSACTION READ ONLY`` statement.
