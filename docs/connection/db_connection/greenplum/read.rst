.. _greenplum-read:

Reading from Greenplum using ``DBReader``
==========================================

.. warning::

    Please take into account :ref:`greenplum-types`.

Data can be read from Greenplum to Spark using :obj:`DBReader <onetl.db.db_reader.db_reader.DBReader>`.
It also supports :ref:`strategy` for incremental data reading.

.. note::

    Unlike JDBC connectors, *Greenplum connector for Spark* does not support
    executing **custom** SQL queries using ``.sql`` method. Connector can be used to only read data from a table or view.

Supported DBReader features
---------------------------

* ✅︎ ``columns`` (see note below)
* ✅︎ ``where`` (see note below)
* ✅︎ ``hwm`` (see note below), supported strategies:
* * ✅︎ :ref:`snapshot-strategy`
* * ✅︎ :ref:`incremental-strategy`
* * ✅︎ :ref:`snapshot-batch-strategy`
* * ✅︎ :ref:`incremental-batch-strategy`
* ❌ ``hint`` (is not supported by Greenplum)
* ❌ ``df_schema``
* ✅︎ ``options`` (see :obj:`GreenplumReadOptions <onetl.connection.db_connection.greenplum.options.GreenplumReadOptions>`)

.. warning::

    In case of Greenplum connector, ``DBReader`` does not generate raw ``SELECT`` query. Instead it relies on Spark SQL syntax
    which in some cases (using column projection and predicate pushdown) can be converted to Greenplum SQL.

    So ``columns``, ``where`` and ``hwm.expression`` should be specified in Spark SQL syntax, not Greenplum SQL.

    This is OK:

    .. code-block:: python

        DBReader(
            columns=[
                "some_column",
                # this cast is executed on Spark side
                "CAST(another_column AS STRING)",
            ],
            # this predicate is parsed by Spark, and can be pushed down to Greenplum
            where="some_column LIKE 'val1%'",
        )

    This is will fail:

    .. code-block:: python

        DBReader(
            columns=[
                "some_column",
                # Spark does not have `text` type
                "CAST(another_column AS text)",
            ],
            # Spark does not support ~ syntax for regexp matching
            where="some_column ~ 'val1.*'",
        )

Examples
--------

Snapshot strategy:

.. code-block:: python

    from onetl.connection import Greenplum
    from onetl.db import DBReader

    greenplum = Greenplum(...)

    reader = DBReader(
        connection=greenplum,
        source="schema.table",
        columns=["id", "key", "CAST(value AS string) value", "updated_dt"],
        where="key = 'something'",
    )
    df = reader.run()

Incremental strategy:

.. code-block:: python

    from onetl.connection import Greenplum
    from onetl.db import DBReader
    from onetl.strategy import IncrementalStrategy

    greenplum = Greenplum(...)

    reader = DBReader(
        connection=greenplum,
        source="schema.table",
        columns=["id", "key", "CAST(value AS string) value", "updated_dt"],
        where="key = 'something'",
        hwm=DBReader.AutoDetectHWM(name="greenplum_hwm", expression="updated_dt"),
    )

    with IncrementalStrategy():
        df = reader.run()

Recommendations
---------------

``DBReader`` in case of Greenplum connector requires view or table to have some column which is used by Spark
for parallel reads.

Choosing proper column allows each Spark executor to read only part of data stored in the specified segment,
avoiding moving large amounts of data between segments, which improves reading performance.

Parallel read using ``gp_segment_id``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, ``DBReader`` will use `gp_segment_id <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Greenplum-Connector-for-Apache-Spark/2.3/greenplum-connector-spark/troubleshooting.html#reading-from-a-view>`_
column for parallel data reading. Each DataFrame partition will contain data of a specific Greenplum segment.

This allows each Spark executor read only data from specific Greenplum segment, avoiding moving large amounts of data between segments.

If view is used, it is recommended to include ``gp_segment_id`` column to this view:

.. dropdown:: Reading from view with gp_segment_id column

    .. code-block:: python

        from onetl.connection import Greenplum
        from onetl.db import DBReader

        greenplum = Greenplum(...)

        greenplum.execute(
            """
            CREATE VIEW schema.view_with_gp_segment_id AS
            SELECT
                id,
                some_column,
                another_column,
                gp_segment_id  -- IMPORTANT
            FROM schema.some_table
            """,
        )

        reader = DBReader(
            connection=greenplum,
            source="schema.view_with_gp_segment_id",
        )
        df = reader.run()

Parallel read using custom ``partition_column``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes table or view is lack of ``gp_segment_id`` column, but there is some column
with value range correlated with Greenplum segment distribution.

In this case, custom column can be used instead:

.. dropdown:: Reading from view with custom partition_column

    .. code-block:: python

        from onetl.connection import Greenplum
        from onetl.db import DBReader

        greenplum = Greenplum(...)

        greenplum.execute(
            """
            CREATE VIEW schema.view_with_partition_column AS
            SELECT
                id,
                some_column,
                part_column  -- correlated to greenplum segment ID
            FROM schema.some_table
            """,
        )

        reader = DBReader(
            connection=greenplum,
            source="schema.view_with_partition_column",
            options=Greenplum.Options(
                # parallelize data using specified column
                partition_column="part_column",
                # create 10 Spark tasks, each will read only part of table data
                num_partitions=10,
            ),
        )
        df = reader.run()

Reading ``DISTRIBUTED REPLICATED`` tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Replicated tables do not have ``gp_segment_id`` column at all, so you need to set ``partition_column`` to some column name
of type integer/bigint/smallint.

Parallel ``JOIN`` execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of using views which require some data motion between Greenplum segments, like ``JOIN`` queries, another approach should be used.

Each Spark executor N will run the same query, so each of N query will start its own JOIN process, leading to really heavy load on Greenplum segments.
**This should be avoided**.

Instead is recommended to run ``JOIN`` query on Greenplum side, save the result to an intermediate table,
and then read this table using ``DBReader``:

.. dropdown:: Reading from view using intermediate table

    .. code-block:: python

        from onetl.connection import Greenplum
        from onetl.db import DBReader

        greenplum = Greenplum(...)

        greenplum.execute(
            """
            CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE schema.intermediate_table AS
            SELECT
                id,
                tbl1.col1,
                tbl1.data,
                tbl2.another_data
            FROM
                schema.table1 as tbl1
            JOIN
                schema.table2 as tbl2
            ON
                tbl1.col1 = tbl2.col2
            WHERE ...
            """,
        )

        reader = DBReader(
            connection=greenplum,
            source="schema.intermediate_table",
        )
        df = reader.run()

        # write dataframe somethere

        greenplum.execute(
            """
            DROP TABLE schema.intermediate_table
            """,
        )

.. warning::

    **NEVER** do that:

    .. code-block:: python

        df1 = DBReader(connection=greenplum, table="public.table1", ...).run()
        df2 = DBReader(connection=greenplum, table="public.table2", ...).run()

        joined_df = df1.join(df2, on="col")

    This will lead to sending all the data from both ``table1`` and ``table2`` to Spark executor memory, and then ``JOIN``
    will be performed on Spark side, not inside Greenplum. This is **VERY** inefficient.

``TEMPORARY`` tables notice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Someone could think that writing data from view or result of ``JOIN`` to ``TEMPORARY`` table,
and then passing it to ``DBReader``, is an efficient way to read data from Greenplum. This is because temp tables are not generating WAL files,
and are automatically deleted after finishing the transaction.

That will **NOT** work. Each Spark executor establishes its own connection to Greenplum.
And each connection starts its own transaction which means that every executor will read empty temporary table.

You should use `UNLOGGED <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Greenplum/7/greenplum-database/ref_guide-sql_commands-CREATE_TABLE.html>`_ tables
to write data to intermediate table without generating WAL logs.
