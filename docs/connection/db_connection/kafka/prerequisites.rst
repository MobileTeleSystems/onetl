.. _kafka-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

Version Compatibility
---------------------

* Kafka server versions: 0.10 or higher
* Spark versions: 2.4.x - 3.5.x
* Java versions: 8 - 17

See `official documentation <https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-kafka-integration.html>`_.

Installing PySpark
------------------

To use Kafka connector you should have PySpark installed (or injected to ``sys.path``)
BEFORE creating the connector instance.

See :ref:`install-spark` installation instruction for more details.

Connecting to Kafka
-----------------------

Connection address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kafka is a distributed service, and usually has a list of brokers you can connect to (unlike other connectors, there only one host+port can be set).
Please contact your Kafka administrator to get addresses of these brokers, as there are no defaults.

Also Kafka has a feature called *advertised listeners* - client connects to one broker, and received list of other brokers in the clusters.
So you don't have to pass all brokers to ``addresses``, it can be some subset. Other broker addresses will be fetched directly from the cluster.

Connection protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kafka can support different connection protocols. List of currently supported protocols:
  * :obj:`PLAINTEXT <onetl.connection.db_connection.kafka.kafka_plaintext_protocol.KafkaPlaintextProtocol>` (not secure)
  * :obj:`SSL <onetl.connection.db_connection.kafka.kafka_ssl_protocol.KafkaSSLProtocol>` (secure, recommended)

Note that specific port can listen for only one of these protocols, so it is important to set
proper port number + protocol combination.

Authentication mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kafka can support different authentication mechanism (also known as `SASL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer>`_).
List of currently supported mechanisms:
  * :obj:`PLAIN <onetl.connection.db_connection.kafka.kafka_basic_auth.KafkaBasicAuth>`. To no confuse this with ``PLAINTEXT`` connection protocol, onETL uses name ``BasicAuth``.
  * :obj:`GSSAPI <onetl.connection.db_connection.kafka.kafka_kerberos_auth.KafkaKerberosAuth>`. To simplify naming, onETL uses name ``KerberosAuth``.
  * :obj:`SCRAM-SHA-256 or SCRAM-SHA-512 <onetl.connection.db_connection.kafka.kafka_scram_auth.KafkaScramAuth>` (recommended).

Different mechanisms use different types of credentials (login + password, keytab file, and so on).

Note that connection protocol and auth mechanism are set in pairs:
  * If you see ``SASL_PLAINTEXT`` this means ``PLAINTEXT`` connection protocol + some auth mechanism.
  * If you see ``SASL_SSL`` this means ``SSL`` connection protocol + some auth mechanism.
  * If you see just ``PLAINTEXT`` or ``SSL`` (**no** ``SASL``), this means that authentication is disabled (anonymous access).

Please contact your Kafka administrator to get details about enabled auth mechanism in a specific Kafka instance.

Required grants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ask your Kafka administrator to set following grants for a user, *if Kafka instance uses ACL*:
  * ``Describe`` + ``Read`` for reading data from Kafka (Consumer).
  * ``Describe`` + ``Write`` for writing data from Kafka (Producer).

More details can be found in `documentation <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#operations_in_kafka>`_.
