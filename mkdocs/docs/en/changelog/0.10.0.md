# 0.10.0 (2023-12-18)

## Breaking Changes

- Upgrade `etl-entities` from v1 to v2 ([#172](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/172)).

  This implies that `HWM` classes are now have different internal structure than they used to.

  Before:

  ```python
  from etl_entities.old_hwm import IntHWM as OldIntHWM
  from etl_entities.source import Column, Table
  from etl_entities.process import Process

  hwm = OldIntHWM(
      process=Process(name="myprocess", task="abc", dag="cde", host="myhost"),
      source=Table(name="schema.table", instance="postgres://host:5432/db"),
      column=Column(name="col1"),
      value=123,
  )
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  from etl_entities.hwm import ColumnIntHWM

  hwm = ColumnIntHWM(
      name="some_unique_name",
      description="any value you want",
      source="schema.table",
      expression="col1",
      value=123,
  )
  ```

  **Breaking change:** If you used HWM classes from `etl_entities` module, you should rewrite your code to make it compatible with new version.

??? "More details"

    - ``HWM`` classes used by previous onETL versions were moved from ``etl_entities`` to ``etl_entities.old_hwm`` submodule. They are here for compatibility reasons, but are planned to be removed in ``etl-entities`` v3 release.
    - New ``HWM`` classes have flat structure instead of nested.
    - New ``HWM`` classes have mandatory ``name`` attribute (it was known as ``qualified_name`` before).
    - Type aliases used while serializing and deserializing ``HWM`` objects to ``dict`` representation were changed too: ``int`` → ``column_int``.


  To make migration simpler, you can use new method:

  ```python
  old_hwm = OldIntHWM(...)
  new_hwm = old_hwm.as_new_hwm()
  ```

  Which automatically converts all fields from old structure to new one, including `qualified_name` → `name`.

- **Breaking changes:**

  - Methods `BaseHWMStore.get()` and `BaseHWMStore.save()` were renamed to `get_hwm()` and `set_hwm()`.
  - They now can be used only with new HWM classes from `etl_entities.hwm`, **old HWM classes are not supported**.

  If you used them in your code, please update it accordingly.

- YAMLHWMStore **CANNOT read files created by older onETL versions** (0.9.x or older).

??? "Update procedure"

    ```python
    # pip install onetl==0.9.5

    # Get qualified_name for HWM


    # Option 1. HWM is built manually
    from etl_entities import IntHWM, FileListHWM

        column=Column(name="col1"),
    )
    qualified_name = old_column_hwm.qualified_name
    # "col1#schema.table@postgres://host:5432/db#cde.abc.myprocess@myhost"

    # )


    # That's all!
    ```

But most of users use other HWM store implementations which do not have such issues.

- Several classes and functions were moved from `onetl` to `etl_entities`:

=== "onETL ``0.9.x`` and older"

    ```python
    from onetl.hwm.store import (
        detect_hwm_store,
        BaseHWMStore,
        HWMStoreClassRegistry,
        register_hwm_store_class,
        HWMStoreManager,
        MemoryHWMStore,
    )
    ```

=== "nETL ``0.10.x`` and newer"

    ```python
    from etl_entities.hwm_store import (
        detect_hwm_store,
        BaseHWMStore,
        HWMStoreClassRegistry,
        register_hwm_store_class,
        HWMStoreManager,
        MemoryHWMStore,
    )
    ```

  They still can be imported from old module, but this is deprecated and will be removed in v1.0.0 release.

- Change the way of passing `HWM` to `DBReader` and `FileDownloader` classes:

=== "onETL ``0.9.x`` and older"

    ```python linenums="1" hl_lines="12-21"
    # Simple
    reader = DBReader(
        connection=...,
        source=...,
        hwm_column="col1",
    )


    # Complex
    reader = DBReader(
        connection=...,
        source=...,
        hwm_column=(
            "col1",
            "cast(col1 as date)",
        ),
    )


    # Files
    downloader = FileDownloader(
        connection=...,
        source_path=...,
        target_path=...,
        hwm_type="file_list",
    )
    ```

=== "onETL ``0.10.x`` and newer"

    ```python linenums="1" hl_lines="12-21"
    # Simple
    reader = DBReader(
        connection=...,
        source=...,
        hwm=DBReader.AutoDetectHWM(
            # name is mandatory now!
            name="my_unique_hwm_name",
            expression="col1",
        ),
    )

    # Complex
    reader = DBReader(
        connection=...,
        source=...,
        hwm=DBReader.AutoDetectHWM(
            # name is mandatory now!
            name="my_unique_hwm_name",
            expression="cast(col1 as date)",
        ),
    )

    # Files
    downloader = FileDownloader(
        connection=...,
        source_path=...,
        target_path=...,
        hwm=FileListHWM(
            # name is mandatory now!
            name="another_unique_hwm_name",
        ),
    )
    ```


  New HWM classes have **mandatory** `name` attribute which should be passed explicitly,
  instead of generating if automatically under the hood.

  Automatic `name` generation using the old `DBReader.hwm_column` / `FileDownloader.hwm_type`
  syntax is still supported, but will be removed in v1.0.0 release. ([#179](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/179))

- Performance of read Incremental and Batch strategies has been drastically improved. ([#182](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/182)).

??? "Before and after in details"

    ``DBReader.run()`` + incremental/batch strategy behavior in versions 0.9.x and older:

    - Get table schema by making query ``SELECT * FROM table WHERE 1=0`` (if ``DBReader.columns`` has ``*``)
    - Expand ``*`` to real column names from table, add here ``hwm_column``, remove duplicates (as some RDBMS does not allow that).
    - Create dataframe from query like ``SELECT hwm_expression AS hwm_column, ...other table columns... FROM table WHERE hwm_expression > prev_hwm.value``.
    - Determine HWM class using dataframe schema: ``df.schema[hwm_column].dataType``.
    - Determine x HWM column value using Spark: ``df.select(max(hwm_column)).collect()``.
    - Use ``max(hwm_column)`` as next HWM value, and save it to HWM Store.
    - Return dataframe to user.

    This was far from ideal:

    - Dataframe content (all rows or just changed ones) was loaded from the source to Spark only to get min/max values of specific column.

    - Step of fetching table schema and then substituting column names in the next query caused some unexpected errors.

        For example, source contains columns with mixed name case, like ``"CamelColumn"`` or ``"spaced column"``.

        Column names were *not* escaped during query generation, leading to queries that cannot be executed by database.

        So users have to *explicitly* pass column names ``DBReader``, wrapping columns with mixed naming with ``"``:

        ```python
        reader = DBReader(
            connection=...,
            source=...,
            columns=[  # passing '*' here leads to wrong SQL query generation
                "normal_column",
                '"CamelColumn"',
                '"spaced column"',
                ...,
            ],
        )
        ```
    - Using ``DBReader`` with ``IncrementalStrategy`` could lead to reading rows already read before.

        Dataframe was created from query with WHERE clause like ``hwm.expression > prev_hwm.value``,
        not ``hwm.expression > prev_hwm.value AND hwm.expression <= current_hwm.value``.

        So if new rows appeared in the source **after** HWM value is determined,
        they can be read by accessing dataframe content (because Spark dataframes are lazy),
        leading to inconsistencies between HWM value and dataframe content.

        This may lead to issues then ``DBReader.run()`` read some data, updated HWM value, and next call of ``DBReader.run()``
        will read rows that were already read in previous run.

    ``DBReader.run()`` + incremental/batch strategy behavior in versions 0.10.x and newer:

    - Detect type of HWM expression: ``SELECT hwm.expression FROM table WHERE 1=0``.
    - Determine corresponding Spark type ``df.schema[0]`` and when determine matching HWM class (if ``DBReader.AutoDetectHWM`` is used).
    - Get min/max values by querying the source: ``SELECT MAX(hwm.expression) FROM table WHERE hwm.expression >= prev_hwm.value``.
    - Use ``max(hwm.expression)`` as next HWM value, and save it to HWM Store.
    - Create dataframe from query ``SELECT ... table columns ... FROM table WHERE hwm.expression > prev_hwm.value AND hwm.expression <= current_hwm.value``, baking new HWM value into the query.
    - Return dataframe to user.

  Improvements:

  - Allow source to calculate min/max instead of loading everything to Spark. This should be **faster** on large amounts of data (**up to x2**), because we do not transfer all the data from the source to Spark. This can be even faster if source have indexes for HWM column.
  - Columns list is passed to source as-is, without any resolving on `DBReader` side. So you can pass `DBReader(columns=["*"])` to read tables with mixed columns naming.
  - Restrict dataframe content to always match HWM values, which leads to never reading the same row twice.

  **Breaking change**: HWM column is not being implicitly added to dataframe. It was a part of `SELECT` clause, but now it is mentioned only in `WHERE` clause.

  So if you had code like this, you have to rewrite it:

=== "onETL ``0.9.x`` and older"

    ```python linenums="1" hl_lines="1-16"
    reader = DBReader(
        connection=...,
        source=...,
        columns=[
            "col1",
            "col2",
        ],
        hwm_column="hwm_col",
    )

    df = reader.run()
    # hwm_column value is in the dataframe
    assert df.columns == ["col1", "col2", "hwm_col"]


    reader = DBReader(
        connection=...,
        source=...,
        columns=[
            "col1",
            "col2",
        ],
        hwm_column=(
            "hwm_col",
            "cast(hwm_col as int)",
        ),
    )

    df = reader.run()
    # hwm_expression value is in the dataframe
    assert df.columns == ["col1", "col2", "hwm_col"]
    ```

=== "onETL ``0.10.x`` and newer"

    ```python linenums="1" hl_lines="1-16"
    reader = DBReader(
        connection=...,
        source=...,
        columns=[
            "col1",
            "col2",
            # add hwm_column explicitly
            "hwm_col",
        ],
        hwm_column="hwm_col",
    )

    df = reader.run()
    # if columns list is not updated,
    # this fill fail
    assert df.columns == ["col1", "col2", "hwm_col"]

    reader = DBReader(
        connection=...,
        source=...,
        columns=[
            "col1",
            "col2",
            # add hwm_expression explicitly
            "cast(hwm_col as int) as hwm_col",
        ],
        hwm_column=(
            "hwm_col",
            "cast(hwm_col as int)",
        ),
    )
    df = reader.run()
    # if columns list is not updated,
    # this fill fail
    assert df.columns == ["col1", "col2", "hwm_col"]
    ```

  But most users just use `columns=["*"]` anyway, they won't see any changes.

- `FileDownloader.run()` now updates HWM in HWM Store not after each file is being successfully downloaded,
  but after all files were handled.

  This is because:

  - FileDownloader can be used with `DownloadOptions(workers=N)`, which could lead to race condition - one thread can save to HWM store one HWM value when another thread will save different value.
  - FileDownloader can download hundreds and thousands of files, and issuing a request to HWM Store for each file could potentially DDoS HWM Store. ([#189](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/189))

  There is a exception handler which tries to save HWM to HWM store if download process was interrupted. But if it was interrupted by force, like sending `SIGKILL` event,
  HWM will not be saved to HWM store, so some already downloaded files may be downloaded again next time.

  But unexpected process kill may produce other negative impact, like some file will be downloaded partially, so this is an expected behavior.

## Features

- Add Python 3.12 compatibility. ([#167](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/167))
- `Excel` file format now can be used with Spark 3.5.0. ([#187](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/187))
- `SnapshotBatchStagy` and `IncrementalBatchStrategy` does no raise exceptions if source does not contain any data.
  Instead they stop at first iteration and return empty dataframe. ([#188](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/188))
- Cache result of `connection.check()` in high-level classes like `DBReader`, `FileDownloader` and so on. This makes logs less verbose. ([#190](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/190))

## Bug Fixes

- Fix `@slot` and `@hook` decorators returning methods with missing arguments in signature (Pylance, VS Code). ([#183](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/183))
- Kafka connector documentation said that it does support reading topic data incrementally by passing `group.id` or `groupIdPrefix`.
  Actually, this is not true, because Spark does not send information to Kafka which messages were consumed.
  So currently users can only read the whole topic, no incremental reads are supported.
