# HWM

Since onETL v0.10.0, the `HWMStore` and `HWM` classes have been moved to a separate library [etl-entities](https://etl-entities.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

The only class was left intact is [YAMLHWMStore](yaml_hwm_store.md#yaml-hwm-store), **which is default** in onETL.

Other known implementation is [HorizonHWMStore](https://horizon-hwm-store.readthedocs.io/).
