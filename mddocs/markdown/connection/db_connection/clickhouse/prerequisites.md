# Prerequisites

## Version Compatibility

* Clickhouse server versions:
  : * Officially declared: 22.8 or higher
    * Actually tested: 21.1, 25.1
* Spark versions: 2.3.x - 3.5.x
* Java versions: 8 - 20

See [official documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/integrations/java#jdbc-driver).

## Installing PySpark

To use Clickhouse connector you should have PySpark installed (or injected to `sys.path`)
BEFORE creating the connector instance.

See [Spark](../../../install/spark.md#install-spark) installation instruction for more details.

## Connecting to Clickhouse

### Connection port

Connector can only use **HTTP** (usually `8123` port) or **HTTPS** (usually `8443` port) protocol.

TCP and GRPC protocols are NOT supported.

### Connecting to cluster

It is possible to connect to Clickhouse cluster, and use itâ€™s load balancing capabilities to read or write data in parallel.
Each Spark executor can connect to random Clickhouse nodes, instead of sending all the data to a node specified in connection params.

This requires all Clickhouse servers to run on different hosts, and **listen the same HTTP port**.
Set `auto_discovery=True` to enable this feature (disabled by default):

```python
Clickhouse(
    host="node1.of.cluster",
    port=8123,
    extra={
        "auto_discovery": True,
        "load_balancing_policy": "roundRobin",
    },
)
```

See [official documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/integrations/java#configuring-node-discovery-load-balancing-and-failover).

### Required grants

Ask your Clickhouse cluster administrator to set following grants for a user,
used for creating a connection:

Read + Write

```sql
-- allow creating tables in the target schema
GRANT CREATE TABLE ON myschema.* TO username;

-- allow read & write access to specific table
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON myschema.mytable TO username;
```

Read only

```sql
-- allow read access to specific table
GRANT SELECT ON myschema.mytable TO username;
```

More details can be found in [official documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant).
