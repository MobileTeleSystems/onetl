# Prerequisites

## Version Compatibility

* PostgreSQL server versions:
  : * Officially declared: 8.2  - 17
    * Actually tested: 9.4.26, 17.3
* Spark versions: 2.3.x - 3.5.x
* Java versions: 8 - 20

See [official documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/).

## Installing PySpark

To use Postgres connector you should have PySpark installed (or injected to `sys.path`)
BEFORE creating the connector instance.

See [Spark](../../../install/spark.md#install-spark) installation instruction for more details.

## Connecting to Postgres

### Allowing connection to Postgres instance

Ask your Postgres administrator to allow your user (and probably IP) to connect to instance,
e.g. by updating `pg_hba.conf` file.

See [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

### Connection port

Connection is usually performed to port 5432. Port may differ for different Postgres instances.
Please ask your Postgres administrator to provide required information.

### Connection host

It is possible to connect to Postgres by using either DNS name of host or it’s IP address.

If you’re using Postgres cluster, it is currently possible to connect only to **one specific node**.
Connecting to multiple nodes to perform load balancing, as well as automatic failover to new master/replica are not supported.

### Required grants

Ask your Postgres cluster administrator to set following grants for a user,
used for creating a connection:

Read + Write

```sql
-- allow creating tables in specific schema
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA myschema TO username;

-- allow read & write access to specific table
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON myschema.mytable TO username;

-- only if if_exists="replace_entire_table" is used:
GRANT TRUNCATE ON myschema.mytable TO username;
```

Read only

```sql
-- allow creating tables in specific schema
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA myschema TO username;

-- allow read access to specific table
GRANT SELECT ON myschema.mytable TO username;
```

More details can be found in [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html).
