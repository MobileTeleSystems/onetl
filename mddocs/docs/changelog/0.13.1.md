# 0.13.1 (2025-03-06)

## Bug Fixes

In 0.13.0, using `DBWriter(connection=hive, target="SOMEDB.SOMETABLE")` lead to executing `df.write.saveAsTable()`
instead of `df.write.insertInto()` if target table `somedb.sometable` already exist.

This is caused by table name normalization (Hive uses lower-case names), which wasn't properly handled by method used for checking table existence.
