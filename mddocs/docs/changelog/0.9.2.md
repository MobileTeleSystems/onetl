# 0.9.2 (2023-09-06)

## Features

- Add `if_exists="ignore"` and `error` to `Greenplum.WriteOptions` ([#142](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/142))

## Improvements

- Improve validation messages while writing dataframe to Kafka. ([#131](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/131))

- Improve documentation:

  - Add notes about reading and writing to database connections documentation
  - Add notes about executing statements in JDBC and Greenplum connections

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed validation of `headers` column is written to Kafka with default `Kafka.WriteOptions()` - default value was `False`,
  but instead of raising an exception, column value was just ignored. ([#131](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/131))
- Fix reading data from Oracle with `partitioningMode="range"` without explicitly set `lowerBound` / `upperBound`. ([#133](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/133))
- Update Kafka documentation with SSLProtocol usage. ([#136](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/136))
- Raise exception if someone tries to read data from Kafka topic which does not exist. ([#138](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/138))
- Allow to pass Kafka topics with name like `some.topic.name` to DBReader. Same for MongoDB collections. ([#139](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/139))
