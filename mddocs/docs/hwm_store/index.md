# HWM

Since onETL v0.10.0, the `HWMStore` and `HWM` classes have been moved to a separate library {etl-entities}`etl-entities <>`.

The only class was left intact is {ref}`yaml-hwm-store`, **which is default** in onETL.

Other known implementation is [HorizonHWMStore](https://horizon-hwm-store.readthedocs.io/).
