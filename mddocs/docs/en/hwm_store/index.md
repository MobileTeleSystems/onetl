# HWM

Since onETL v0.10.0, the `HWMStore` and `HWM` classes have been moved to a separate library {{ etl_entities_link }}.

The only class was left intact is [`yaml-hwm-store`][yaml-hwm-store], **which is default** in onETL.

Other known implementation is [HorizonHWMStore](https://horizon-hwm-store.readthedocs.io/).

* [YAML HWM Store][yaml-hwm-store]
