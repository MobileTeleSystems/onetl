# 0.8.0 (2023-05-31) { #0.8.0 }

## Breaking Changes

- Rename methods of `FileConnection` classes:

  - `get_directory` → `resolve_dir`
  - `get_file` → `resolve_file`
  - `listdir` → `list_dir`
  - `mkdir` → `create_dir`
  - `rmdir` → `remove_dir`

  New naming should be more consistent.

  They were undocumented in previous versions, but someone could use these methods, so this is a breaking change. ([#36](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/36))

- Deprecate `onetl.core.FileFilter` class, replace it with new classes:

  - `onetl.file.filter.Glob`
  - `onetl.file.filter.Regexp`
  - `onetl.file.filter.ExcludeDir`

  Old class will be removed in v1.0.0. ([#43](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/43))

- Deprecate `onetl.core.FileLimit` class, replace it with new class `onetl.file.limit.MaxFilesCount`.

  Old class will be removed in v1.0.0. ([#44](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/44))

- Change behavior of `BaseFileLimit.reset` method.

  This method should now return `self` instead of `None`.
  Return value could be the same limit object or a copy, this is an implementation detail. ([#44](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/44))

- Replaced `FileDownloader.filter` and `.limit` with new options `.filters` and `.limits`:

  ``` python title="onETL < 0.8.0"
  FileDownloader(
      ...,
      filter=FileFilter(glob="*.txt", exclude_dir="/path"),
      limit=FileLimit(count_limit=10),
  )
  ```

  ``` python title="onETL >= 0.8.0"
  FileDownloader(
      ...,
      filters=[Glob("*.txt"), ExcludeDir("/path")],
      limits=[MaxFilesCount(10)],
  )
  ```

  This allows to developers to implement their own filter and limit classes, and combine them with existing ones.

  Old behavior still supported, but it will be removed in v1.0.0. ([#45](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/45))

- Removed default value for `FileDownloader.limits`, user should pass limits list explicitly. ([#45](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/45))

- Move classes from module `onetl.core`:

  ``` python title="before"
  from onetl.core import DBReader
  from onetl.core import DBWriter
  from onetl.core import FileDownloader
  from onetl.core import FileUploader
  ```

  with new modules `onetl.db` and `onetl.file`:

  ``` python title="after"
  from onetl.db import DBReader
  from onetl.db import DBWriter

  from onetl.file import FileDownloader
  from onetl.file import FileUploader
  ```

  Imports from old module `onetl.core` still can be used, but marked as deprecated. Module will be removed in v1.0.0. ([#46](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/46))

## Features

- Add `rename_dir` method.

  Method was added to following connections:

  - `FTP`
  - `FTPS`
  - `HDFS`
  - `SFTP`
  - `WebDAV`

  It allows to rename/move directory to new path with all its content.

  `S3` does not have directories, so there is no such method in that class. ([#40](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/40))

- Add `onetl.file.FileMover` class.

  It allows to move files between directories of remote file system.
  Signature is almost the same as in `FileDownloader`, but without HWM support. ([#42](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/42))

## Improvements

- Document all public methods in `FileConnection` classes:

  - `download_file`
  - `resolve_dir`
  - `resolve_file`
  - `get_stat`
  - `is_dir`
  - `is_file`
  - `list_dir`
  - `create_dir`
  - `path_exists`
  - `remove_file`
  - `rename_file`
  - `remove_dir`
  - `upload_file`
  - `walk` ([#39](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/39))

- Update documentation of `check` method of all connections - add usage example and document result type. ([#39](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/39))

- Add new exception type `FileSizeMismatchError`.

  Methods `connection.download_file` and `connection.upload_file` now raise new exception type instead of `RuntimeError`,
  if target file after download/upload has different size than source. ([#39](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/39))

- Add new exception type `DirectoryExistsError` - it is raised if target directory already exists. ([#40](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/40))

- Improved `FileDownloader` / `FileUploader` exception logging.

  If `DEBUG` logging is enabled, print exception with stacktrace instead of
  printing only exception message. ([#42](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/42))

- Updated documentation of `FileUploader`.

  - Class does not support read strategies, added note to documentation.
  - Added examples of using `run` method with explicit files list passing, both absolute and relative paths.
  - Fix outdated imports and class names in examples. ([#42](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/42))

- Updated documentation of `DownloadResult` class - fix outdated imports and class names. ([#42](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/42))

- Improved file filters documentation section.

  Document interface class `onetl.base.BaseFileFilter` and function `match_all_filters`. ([#43](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/43))

- Improved file limits documentation section.

  Document interface class `onetl.base.BaseFileLimit` and functions `limits_stop_at` / `limits_reached` / `reset_limits`. ([#44](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/44))

- Added changelog.

  Changelog is generated from separated news files using [towncrier](https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/). ([#47](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/47))

## Misc

- Improved CI workflow for tests.

  - If developer haven't changed source core of a specific connector or its dependencies,
    run tests only against maximum supported versions of Spark, Python, Java and db/file server.
  - If developed made some changes in a specific connector, or in core classes, or in dependencies,
    run tests for both minimal and maximum versions.
  - Once a week run all aganst for minimal and latest versions to detect breaking changes in dependencies
  - Minimal tested Spark version is 2.3.1 instead on 2.4.8. ([#32](https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/onetl/pull/32))
