# Writing to Hive using `DBWriter`

For writing data to Hive, use [`DBWriter`](../../../db/db_writer.md#onetl.db.db_writer.db_writer.DBWriter).

## Examples

```python
from onetl.connection import Hive
from onetl.db import DBWriter

hive = Hive(...)

df = ...  # data is here

# Create dataframe with specific number of Spark partitions.
# Use the Hive partitioning columns to group the data. Create max 20 files per Hive partition.
# Also sort the data by column which most data is correlated with (e.g. user_id), reducing files size.

num_files_per_partition = 20
partition_columns = ["country", "business_date"]
sort_columns = ["user_id"]
write_df = df.repartition(
    num_files_per_partition,
    *partition_columns,
    *sort_columns,
).sortWithinPartitions(*partition_columns, *sort_columns)

writer = DBWriter(
    connection=hive,
    target="schema.table",
    options=Hive.WriteOptions(
        if_exists="append",
        # Hive partitioning columns.
        partitionBy=partition_columns,
    ),
)

writer.run(write_df)
```

## Recommendations

### Use column-based write formats

Prefer these write formats:
: * [ORC](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-orc.html) (**default**)
  * [Parquet](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-parquet.html)
  * [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/spark-quickstart/)
  * [Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/quick-start-guide/)
  * [Delta](https://docs.delta.io/latest/quick-start.html#set-up-apache-spark-with-delta-lake)

#### WARNING
When using `DBWriter`, the default spark data format configured in `spark.sql.sources.default` is ignored, as  `Hive.WriteOptions(format=...)` default value is explicitly set to `orc`.

For column-based write formats, each file contains separated sections where column data is stored. The file footer contains
location of each column section/group. Spark can use this information to load only sections required by specific query, e.g. only selected columns,
to drastically speed up the query.

Another advantage is high compression ratio, e.g. 10x-100x in comparison to JSON or CSV.

### Use partitioning

#### How does it work

Hive support splitting data to partitions, which are different directories in filesystem with names like `some_col=value1/another_col=value2`.

For example, dataframe with content like this:

| country: string   | business_date: date   |   user_id: int |   bytes: long |
|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------|---------------|
| RU                | 2024-01-01            |           1234 |   25325253525 |
| RU                | 2024-01-01            |           2345 |   23234535243 |
| RU                | 2024-01-02            |           1234 |   62346634564 |
| US                | 2024-01-01            |           5678 |    4252345354 |
| US                | 2024-01-02            |           5678 |    5474575745 |
| US                | 2024-01-03            |           5678 |    3464574567 |

With `partitionBy=["country", "business_dt"]` data will be stored as files in the following subfolders:
: * `/country=RU/business_date=2024-01-01/`
  * `/country=RU/business_date=2024-01-02/`
  * `/country=US/business_date=2024-01-01/`
  * `/country=US/business_date=2024-01-02/`
  * `/country=US/business_date=2024-01-03/`

A separated subdirectory is created for each distinct combination of column values in the dataframe.

Please do not confuse Spark dataframe partitions (a.k.a batches of data handled by Spark executors, usually in parallel)
and Hive partitioning (store data in different subdirectories).
Number of Spark dataframe partitions is correlated the number of files created in **each** Hive partition.
For example, Spark dataframe with 10 partitions and 5 distinct values of Hive partition columns will be saved as 5 subfolders with 10 files each = 50 files in total.
Without Hive partitioning, all the files are placed into one flat directory.

#### But why?

Queries which has `WHERE` clause with filters on Hive partitioning columns, like `WHERE country = 'RU' AND business_date='2024-01-01'`, will
read only files from this exact partitions, like `/country=RU/business_date=2024-01-01/`, and skip files from other partitions.

This drastically increases performance and reduces the amount of memory used by Spark.
Consider using Hive partitioning in all tables.

#### Which columns should I use?

Usually Hive partitioning columns are based on event date or location, like `country: string`, `business_date: date`, `run_date: date` and so on.

**Partition columns should contain data with low cardinality.**
Dates, small integers, strings with low number of possible values are OK.
But timestamp, float, decimals, longs (like user id), strings with lots oj unique values (like user name or email) should **NOT** be used as Hive partitioning columns.
Unlike some other databases, range and hash-based partitions are not supported.

Partition column should be a part of a dataframe. If you want to partition values by date component of `business_dt: timestamp` column,
add a new column to dataframe like this: `df.withColumn("business_date", date(df.business_dt))`.

### Use compression

Using compression algorithms like `snappy`, `lz4` or `zstd` can reduce the size of files (up to 10x).

### Prefer creating large files

Storing millions of small files is not that HDFS and S3 are designed for. Minimal file size should be at least 10Mb, but usually it is like 128Mb+ or 256Mb+ (HDFS block size).
**NEVER** create files with few Kbytes in size.

Number of files can be different in different cases.
On one hand, Spark Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) can merge small Spark dataframe partitions into one larger.
On the other hand, dataframes with skewed data can produce a larger number of files than expected.

To create small amount of large files, you can reduce number of Spark dataframe partitions.
Use [df.repartition(N, columnsâ€¦)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.repartition.html) function,
like this: `df.repartition(20, "col1", "col2")`.
This creates new Spark dataframe with partitions using `hash(df.col1 + df.col2) mod 20` expression, avoiding data skew.

Note: larger dataframe partitions requires more resources (CPU, RAM) on Spark executor. The exact number of partitions
should be determined empirically, as it depends on the amount of data and available resources.

### Sort data before writing

Dataframe with sorted content:

| country: string   | business_date: date   |   user_id: int | business_dt: timestamp   |   bytes: long |
|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| RU                | 2024-01-01            |           1234 | 2024-01-01T11:22:33.456  |   25325253525 |
| RU                | 2024-01-01            |           1234 | 2024-01-01T12:23:44.567  |   25325253525 |
| RU                | 2024-01-02            |           1234 | 2024-01-01T13:25:56.789  |   34335645635 |
| US                | 2024-01-01            |           2345 | 2024-01-01T10:00:00.000  |         12341 |
| US                | 2024-01-02            |           2345 | 2024-01-01T15:11:22.345  |         13435 |
| US                | 2024-01-03            |           2345 | 2024-01-01T20:22:33.567  |         14564 |

Has a much better compression rate than unsorted one, e.g. 2x or even higher:

| country: string   | business_date: date   |   user_id: int | business_dt: timestamp   |   bytes: long |
|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| RU                | 2024-01-01            |           1234 | 2024-01-01T11:22:33.456  |   25325253525 |
| RU                | 2024-01-01            |           6345 | 2024-12-01T23:03:44.567  |         25365 |
| RU                | 2024-01-02            |           5234 | 2024-07-01T06:10:56.789  |   45643456747 |
| US                | 2024-01-01            |           4582 | 2024-04-01T17:59:00.000  |     362546475 |
| US                | 2024-01-02            |           2345 | 2024-09-01T04:24:22.345  |          3235 |
| US                | 2024-01-03            |           3575 | 2024-03-01T21:37:33.567  |     346345764 |

Choosing columns to sort data by is really depends on the data. If data is correlated with some specific
column, like in example above the amount of traffic is correlated with both `user_id` and `timestamp`,
use `df.sortWithinPartitions("user_id", "timestamp")` before writing the data.

If `df.repartition(N, repartition_columns...)` is used in combination with `df.sortWithinPartitions(sort_columns...)`,
then `sort_columns` should start with `repartition_columns` or be equal to it.

## Options

### *pydantic model* onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions

Hive source writing options.

You can pass here key-value items which then will be converted to calls
of `pyspark.sql.readwriter.DataFrameWriter` methods.

For example, `Hive.WriteOptions(if_exists="append", partitionBy="reg_id")` will
be converted to `df.write.mode("append").partitionBy("reg_id")` call, and so on.

### Examples

#### NOTE
You can pass any method name and its value
[supported by Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-load-save-functions.html),
even if it is not mentioned in this documentation. **Option names should be in** `camelCase`!

The set of supported options depends on Spark version used.

```python
from onetl.connection import Hive

options = Hive.WriteOptions(
    if_exists="append",
    partitionBy="reg_id",
    customSparkOption="value",
)
```

<!-- !! processed by numpydoc !! -->

#### *field* if_exists *: HiveTableExistBehavior* *= HiveTableExistBehavior.APPEND* *(alias 'mode')*

Behavior of writing data into existing table.

Possible values:
: * `append` (default)
    : Appends data into existing partition/table, or create partition/table if it does not exist.
      <br/>
      Same as Sparkâ€™s `df.write.insertInto(table, overwrite=False)`.
      <br/>
      ### Behavior in details
      <br/>
      * Table does not exist
        : Table is created using options provided by user (`format`, `compression`, etc).
      * Table exists, but not partitioned, [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by) is set
        : Data is appended to a table. Table is still not partitioned (DDL is unchanged).
      * Table exists and partitioned, but has different partitioning schema than [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by)
        : Partition is created based on tableâ€™s `PARTITIONED BY (...)` options.
          Explicit [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by) value is ignored.
      * Table exists and partitioned according [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by), but partition is present only in dataframe
        : Partition is created.
      * Table exists and partitioned according [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by), partition is present in both dataframe and table
        : Data is appended to existing partition.
          <br/>
          #### WARNING
          This mode does not check whether table already contains
          rows from dataframe, so duplicated rows can be created.
          <br/>
          To implement deduplication, write data to staging table first,
          and then perform some deduplication logic using `sql`.
      * Table exists and partitioned according [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by), but partition is present only in table, not dataframe
        : Existing partition is left intact.
  * `replace_overlapping_partitions`
    : Overwrites data in the existing partition, or create partition/table if it does not exist.
      <br/>
      Same as Sparkâ€™s `df.write.insertInto(table, overwrite=True)` +
      `spark.sql.sources.partitionOverwriteMode=dynamic`.
      <br/>
      ### Behavior in details
      <br/>
      * Table does not exist
        : Table is created using options provided by user (`format`, `compression`, etc).
      * Table exists, but not partitioned, [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by) is set
        : Data is **overwritten in all the table**. Table is still not partitioned (DDL is unchanged).
      * Table exists and partitioned, but has different partitioning schema than [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by)
        : Partition is created based on tableâ€™s `PARTITIONED BY (...)` options.
          Explicit [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by) value is ignored.
      * Table exists and partitioned according [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by), but partition is present only in dataframe
        : Partition is created.
      * Table exists and partitioned according [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by), partition is present in both dataframe and table
        : Existing partition **replaced** with data from dataframe.
      * Table exists and partitioned according [`partition_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.partition_by), but partition is present only in table, not dataframe
        : Existing partition is left intact.
  * `replace_entire_table`
    : **Recreates table** (via `DROP + CREATE`), **deleting all existing data**.
      **All existing partitions are dropped.**
      <br/>
      Same as Sparkâ€™s `df.write.saveAsTable(table, mode="overwrite")` (NOT `insertInto`)!
      <br/>
      #### WARNING
      Table is recreated using options provided by user (`format`, `compression`, etc)
      **instead of using original table options**. Be careful
  * `ignore`
    : Ignores the write operation if the table/partition already exists.
      <br/>
      ### Behavior in details
      <br/>
      * Table does not exist
        : Table is created using options provided by user (`format`, `compression`, etc).
      * Table exists
        : If the table exists, **no further action is taken**. This is true whether or not new partition
          values are present and whether the partitioning scheme differs or not
  * `error`
    : Raises an error if the table/partition already exists.
      <br/>
      ### Behavior in details
      <br/>
      * Table does not exist
        : Table is created using options provided by user (`format`, `compression`, etc).
      * Table exists
        : If the table exists, **raises an error**. This is true whether or not new partition
          values are present and whether the partitioning scheme differs or not

#### NOTE
Unlike using pure Spark, config option `spark.sql.sources.partitionOverwriteMode`
does not affect behavior.

<!-- !! processed by numpydoc !! -->

#### *field* format *: str | [BaseWritableFileFormat](../../../file_df/file_formats/base.md#onetl.base.base_file_format.BaseWritableFileFormat)* *= 'orc'*

Format of files which should be used for storing table data.

### Examples

- string format: `"orc"` (default), `"parquet"`, `"csv"` (NOT recommended).
- format class instance: `ORC(compression="snappy")`, `Parquet()`, `CSV(header=True, delimiter=",")`.

```default
options = Hive.WriteOptions(
    if_exists="append",
    partitionBy="reg_id",
    format="orc",
)

# or using an ORC format class instance:

from onetl.file.format import ORC

options = Hive.WriteOptions(
    if_exists="append",
    partitionBy="reg_id",
    format=ORC(compression="snappy"),
)
```

#### NOTE
Itâ€™s better to use column-based formats like `orc` or `parquet`,
not row-based (`csv`, `json`)

#### WARNING
Used **only** while **creating new table**, or in case of `if_exists=replace_entire_table`

<!-- !! processed by numpydoc !! -->

#### *field* partition_by *: List[str] | str | None* *= None* *(alias 'partitionBy')*

List of columns should be used for data partitioning. `None` means partitioning is disabled.

Examples: `reg_id` or `["reg_id", "business_dt"]`

#### WARNING
Used **only** while **creating new table**, or in case of `if_exists=replace_entire_table`

<!-- !! processed by numpydoc !! -->

#### *field* bucket_by *: Tuple[int, List[str] | str] | None* *= None* *(alias 'bucketBy')*

Number of buckets plus bucketing columns. `None` means bucketing is disabled.

Each bucket is created as a set of files with name containing result of calculation `hash(columns) mod num_buckets`.

This allows to remove shuffle from queries containing `GROUP BY` or `JOIN` or using `=` / `IN` predicates
on specific columns.

Examples: `(10, "user_id")`, `(10, ["user_id", "user_phone"])`

#### NOTE
Bucketing should be used on columns containing a lot of unique values,
like `userId`.

Columns like `date` should **NOT** be used for bucketing
because of too low number of unique values.

#### WARNING
It is recommended to use this option **ONLY** if you have a large table
(hundreds of Gb or more), which is used mostly for JOINs with other tables,
and youâ€™re inserting data using `if_exists=overwrite_partitions` or `if_exists=replace_entire_table`.

Otherwise Spark will create a lot of small files
(one file for each bucket and each executor), drastically **decreasing** HDFS performance.

#### WARNING
Used **only** while **creating new table**, or in case of `if_exists=replace_entire_table`

<!-- !! processed by numpydoc !! -->

#### *field* sort_by *: List[str] | str | None* *= None* *(alias 'sortBy')*

Each file in a bucket will be sorted by these columns value. `None` means sorting is disabled.

Examples: `user_id` or `["user_id", "user_phone"]`

#### NOTE
Sorting columns should contain values which are used in `ORDER BY` clauses.

#### WARNING
Could be used only with [`bucket_by`](#onetl.connection.db_connection.hive.options.HiveWriteOptions.bucket_by) option

#### WARNING
Used **only** while **creating new table**, or in case of `if_exists=replace_entire_table`

<!-- !! processed by numpydoc !! -->

#### *field* compression *: str | None* *= None*

Compressing algorithm which should be used for compressing created files in HDFS.
`None` means compression is disabled.

Examples: `snappy`, `zlib`

#### WARNING
Used **only** while **creating new table**, or in case of `if_exists=replace_entire_table`
